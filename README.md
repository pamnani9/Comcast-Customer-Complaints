# Comcast-Customer-Complaints

# Introduction :
Comcast Company in US was facing various problems related to customer complaints. There were different types of complaints related to internet, bills and other related problems.
It is a telecommunication company and wants to improve the Customer experience by identifying the problem areas that lower the customer satisfaction.So, I have tried something. Hope you like it!

# Purpose :
Every Company wants that the customers should be satisfied with their experience. So, My aim was to identify the complaints on which the company can work and can provide better experience to the customers.
Here, I have used Numpy, Pandas, WordCloud and Seaborn to give the details about the complaints. Here I found out the low ratings and high ratings
and according to that I was reached to a conclusion.
